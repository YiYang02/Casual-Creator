# Interactive Fireworks Designer

## Overview

**Interactive Fireworks Designer** allows users to create dazzling displays of fireworks by turning users' drawings into a breathtaking fireworks show, providing a canvas for creativity and expression. If the user does not wish to create a design, the default fireworks display will be shown.

### What Users Can Create

- **Digital Gardens**: Users can draw flowers, trees, and nature scenes that transform into fireworks, mimicking the growth and bloom of a garden.
- **Constellations and Celestial Designs**: Starry patterns and cosmic designs take on a new life as they light up the sky.
- **Artistic Creations**: Abstract designs, stained glass window patterns, or even simple doodles become part of a stunning aerial display.

### Engagement and Creative Flow

- **Interactive Design**: The platform responds to every stroke, allowing users to see a preview of their fireworks in real time.
- **Surprise Elements**: Randomized elements like color shifts and explosion effects keep the experience fresh and exciting.
- **Flow State Encouragement**: The intuitive and seamless interface is designed to help users stay immersed in their creative process without unnecessary distractions. The program is simple: simply create your own firework design and then watch the fireworks in action!

### Pride and Sharing

- **Unique Creations**: Each firework display is a reflection of the user's creativity, making every show unique and personal.
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Users can save and screenshot their firework displays, allowing them to showcase their creativity on social media or as digital art pieces.

## Personal Significance

This system is personally significant because I've loved watching fireworks ever since I was a kid. In New York City so every fourth of July, Macy's would host a grand fireworks show! I would go almost every year since I was a kid. It was so grandoise that regardless of which borough I was in, as long as I faced the right direction... I could see the fireworks! I remember being able to see the fireworks last year from Staten Island! I wanted to somehow replicate that awe and excitement of watching the fireworks in a virtual form. Moreover, this year I was not able to watch the fireworks with my girlfriend, so I wanted to send her my version of the fireworks, in lieu of what we missed. Thus this project was born! 

In addition, I wanted users to craft their own fireworks design as fireworks is something that is not only beautiful when watched but also shared with loved ones.

## Challenges and Learnings

Working on the Interactive Fireworks Designer presented a unique set of challenges that pushed me beyond my comfort zone as a computer scientist. One significant challenge was integrating complex graphical algorithms to translate user inputs into visually appealing and dynamic fireworks displays. This required a deep dive into computational geometry and particle physics, areas that were relatively new to me. 

Another hurdle was optimizing the performance of the application. Rendering  fireworks in real-time, especially with user designs, made computation complex. I had to balance the visual fidelity of the fireworks with the responsiveness of my system. It involved meticulous testing and tweaking, from adjusting particle lifespans to fine-tuning the physics of each explosion.

Another hurdle was debugging. Since I was using the OpenProcessing website, it wasn't easy to debug my code. For one, the error messages made no sense! The stack trace did not point me to the correct line of error in my code. Thus, I had to use a lot of print statements to debug and ensure that my logic was correct. There are many times as a computer scientist where I would code and then debug, but this project involved lots more planning than coding! 

In addition, I ensured that my code was modular and followed OOP principles. Consequently, I created a Particle and Fireworks class! 

Looking forward, I aim to incorporate more advanced techniques such as machine learning to predict and suggest fireworks patterns based on user preferences, and to explore more sophisticated physics models for even more realistic animations. 


## Known Bugs

- Complex user designs may not always translate perfectly into the firework patterns due to the limitations of particle system representations.
